Exercise Answers from "Python for Everybody: Exploring Data Using Python 3" by Charles Severance

9.2: Write a program that categorizes each mail message by which day of
the week the commit was done. To do this look for lines that start with “From”,
then look for the third word and keep a running count of each of the days of the
week. At the end of the program print out the contents of your dictionary (order
does not matter).

9.3: Write a program to read through a mail log, build a histogram using
a dictionary to count how many messages have come from each email address, and
print the dictionary.

9.4: Add code to the above program to figure out who has the most
messages in the file.
After all the data has been read and the dictionary has been created, look through
the dictionary using a maximum loop (see Section [maximumloop]) to find who
has the most messages and print how many messages the person has.

9.5: This program records the domain name (instead of the address) where
the message was sent from instead of who the mail came from (i.e., the whole email
address). At the end of the program, print out the contents of your dictionary.
